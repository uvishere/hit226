## Device testing
You don't always have multiple devices on which to test your site but there are some ways we can do the next best thing.

### Inside of Chrome

You can also simulate devices right inside of Chrome, read through the Google Developers article on Chrome Device Mode

https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/

### Mobile testing websites

Upload your page/s to GitHub pages first and then use the URL to the page when testing.

* [Mobile Test](http://mobiletest.me/)
* [Mobile Phone Emulator](http://www.mobilephoneemulator.com/)
* [Google's Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

## Finishing up


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Make a checklist
* Create a checklist of things you need to deliver
* Before handing your project over go through your checklist
* Is there anything you forgot to double check?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Example checklist
* Is your spelling and grammar correct
* Does your website validate
* Does it adhere to best practices
* Make sure there are no broken links
* Do all images work?

### Have a finishing meeting
* Get together and discuss what you need to do
* Is anything missing?
* Has everyone finished their part?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Review your documentation
You might not look at your project again for a while. But what if you have to pick it up in a year?

Ensure your documentation tells you
* Where do you find resources?
* What guidelines does the project follow?
* Does the project have any dependencies?
	* e.g. external resources

### Walk through the hosted website
* Sometimes things change when you deploy to the server
* Walk through your site and make sure it works
* Do this with your checklist
* Test on multiple devices


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Iterate so your product is ready to use
* Try and design and develop your MVPs so they are ready to go
* Test your MVP, design a new one and develop it
* You can do this forever but you can also stop any time


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Learn from the experience
* What lessons have you learned
* What went well?
* What didn't?
* What would you do the same or differenly

### All the best for your project

## Exam preparation
* In your teams grab a whiteboard
* Can you draw page with the HTML, CSS and JS from the [exam last year](http://ereadings.cdu.edu.au/login.php?url=list/?search_keys%5B0%5D=)?

## Device testing
You don't always have multiple devices on which to test your site but there are some ways we can do the next best thing.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Inside of Chrome

You can also simulate devices right inside of Chrome, read through the Google Developers article on Chrome Device Mode

https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/ 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Mobile testing websites

Upload your page/s to GitHub pages first and then use the URL to the page when testing.

* [Mobile Test](http://mobiletest.me/)
* [Mobile Phone Emulator](http://www.mobilephoneemulator.com/)
* [Google's Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

### Remote debugging on real devices

* [Android](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/remote-debugging/remote-debugging?hl=en)
* [iPhone](http://moduscreate.com/enable-remote-web-inspector-in-ios-6/)

## Continuous learning

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### So much change
* Web development is constantly changing
* New technologies every year
* New frameworks every year
* New libraries every month


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### I don't use what I started with
* I started as PHP developer
* Then a Java web developer (not javascript)
* Then front end javascript
* Then jQuery AJAX web development
* Then a bunch of PHP frameworks
* Now Node and heaps of javascript frameworks


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### Change is good
* It can be daunting to keep on top of the industry
* But it is also really cool
	* Always more to learn
	* Interesting and exciting
	* Lots of fun, passionate community discussions


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
### You need to teach yourself
* New languages, frameworks and tools appear all the time
* Most developers teach themselves

### Great ways to learn


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Engage with the community
* Connect with community groups
* Join online discussions
* Participate in [hackathons](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-why-do-developers-participate-in-hackathons)


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Follow blogs and podcasts
* Keeps you up to date with new technologies
* Lots of shiny new stuff to keep you excited about development


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Create your own project
* Working through a project is a great way to build your skills
	* You get to choose what technology you use
	* No business constraints
* There are two types of personal projects
	* Those you finish
	* Those you learn from and throw away
* I have 100s of unfinished projects but I used them to learn new skills which I later applied to work


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Answer questions on Stack Overflow
* Solving problems is the best way to learn
* Look at the questions on stack overflow for something you think you can answer
* Research and answer it. Try to make your answer as strong as possible
* Read the documentation to make sure you're correct
* Write code examples


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-mouse.jpg" -->
#### Contribute to open source projects
* Working with other peoples code is a great way to learn to write better
* If a library on github doesn't quite do what you want - modify it so it does
